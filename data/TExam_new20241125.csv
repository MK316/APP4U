Below are parts of the lyrics from the song, which show how the game is played with three common English names: Tony [tóni], Lana [l'na], and Kit [kít]. The phonetic transcription of the lyrics is provided below: As shown in the lyrics above, the name game works with various names that consist of different segments or differ in length.

b. Miranda [maranda]
c. Nelson [nelsan]
d. Pat [pat]
