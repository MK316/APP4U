What do you think Peter bought it
What do you think that Peter bought it

Wh-movement from subject position, however, is only possible when there is no overt that complementizer. This phenomenon is called the that-trace effect.

Who do you think invited Peter
Who do you think that it invited Peter

Relative clauses share with wh-questions the property of having an argument or adjunct missing within the clause. The who wh-phrase in the following example is fronted to the beginning of the clause, leaving a gap where we expect the argument to be.

He has asked who I saw
He met the poor girl who I invited

Thus, it is only natural that the that-trace effect also applies to relative clauses, as can be seen in the following examples.

She saw the boy who she thought I was her boyfriend
She saw the boy who she thought that I was her boyfriend  Who do you think that they told me that would come
I only recommend a program I feel will help improve your English

2025_1.PNG,2025_1,"subject raising, subject control, raising, control, diagnostic test","In general, the matrix subject is semantically associated with the matrix verb, which is called an ordinary subject.

Chris experienced the feeling of wanting to convince Max
In some cases, the matrix subject does not have a direct semantic relationship with the matrix verb, but semantically belongs solely in the embedded clause. This is called a raised subject. The meaning of this sentence is very close to that of Chris seemed convinced Max.

Chris tried to convince Max
Chris seemed to convince Max

There are diagnostic tests to distinguish one from the other, which include using meaningless dummy pronouns and voice transparency. First, a dummy pronoun, such as there or it, cannot appear in the ordinary subject position, as shown in the example which suggests that the subject of want is an ordinary subject. In contrast, the pronoun can appear in the raised subject position, so the appearance of there in the example suggests that the subject of seem is a raised subject.

There wants to be plenty of time
There seems to be plenty of time

The second diagnostic test involves voice transparency between active and passive forms, and only the sentence with a raised subject can denote the same meaning with its passive counterpart. Consider the sentences which are the passive counterparts of the examples respectively.

Max was convinced by Chris
Max seemed to be convinced by Chris

Note that this sentence does not have the same truth condition with the first sentence, as the subject of want refers to Max in the first sentence. In contrast, this sentence is truth conditionally equivalent to the second sentence, as the subject of seem demonstrates that the subject of want is an ordinary subject and that of seem is a raised subject. Now consider the sentences.

The fire fighter attempted to save the man
The fire fighter happened to save the man

The two diagnostic tests can reveal that the second sentence contains a raised subject."
2025_2.PNG,2025_2,"thematic relation, argument theta role, theta-role, theta grid, theta-grid, theta criterion, theta-criterion, relative clause","It is well known that predicates can take different numbers of obligatory arguments. For example, a transitive predicate like hit requires two arguments, a subject and an object, and an intransitive predicate like put requires three arguments, a subject, a direct object, and an objective predicative complement.

Bill hit the ball
Bill put the vase on the table

One way to encode these restrictions is to use thematic relations, where each argument receives a specific theta role assigned by the verb. For instance, Bill in hit assigns an agent theta role to Bill and a theme theta role to the ball. This thematic relation can be represented formally in a structure called a theta grid. The theta grid for hit is as follows.

Hit assigns agent noun phrase and theme noun phrase

To ensure that a sentence is grammatical, two conditions must be met. Each argument must receive only one theta role, and each theta role must be assigned to only one argument. This requirement is known as the theta criterion.

One relative clause introduces an intriguing pattern. A relative pronoun can either appear or remain silent, as seen in the following example.

John met the man who Mary kissed

It is assumed that the relative pronoun who originally appears in the object position of the relative clause and moves to the front of the embedded clause. This movement is called wh movement. The silent counterpart that corresponds to the relative pronoun is assumed to follow the same process.

John met the man Mary kissed
John met the man who Mary kissed

2024_1.PNG,2024_1,"passive, external argument, expletive, passive, raising, EPP, Case, Burzio's generalization","Passive predicates are known to have no external arguments, that is, subject arguments. Therefore, the passive sentences are uninterpretable but ungrammatical because every sentence requires an overt subject.

It is believed that the team will win
The team is believed that the team will win

In this context, the expletive it is a meaningless placeholder, can make a grammatical sentence. Despite insertion of it, however, the sentence remains ungrammatical. The only difference between the two sentences is whether the complement clause is finite or non finite.

It is believed that the team will win
It is believed the team to win

Moreover, the same pattern holds in raising predicates. It seems that the team will win
It seems the team to win

The unexpected parallel between passive and raising predicates can be accounted for by the empirically attested observation, which states that a predicate which has no external argument cannot assign accusative or objective case. Accordingly, the ungrammaticality of the sentence is because the noun phrase the team is case less because passive and raising predicates are unable to assign accusative case to it.

This case less noun phrase problem can be solved by moving the case assigned position, such as the subject position of the finite clause or the object position of the transitive verb, without an insertion.

The team is believed to win
The team seems to win

For instance, in the sentence The seminar was about language in France, the meaning of the phrase in France may modify either the seminar or language to make a difference in meaning.

I went to a seminar on language in France

In syntax, branches are not allowed to cross in tree structures, which is also known as the No Crossing Branches constraint. This constraint can be seen in the sentence which is ungrammatical due to a violation of the No Crossing Branches constraint.

2023_2.PNG,2023_2,"parts of speech, distribution, distributional context ","Traditionally, the parts of speech such as adjective, adverb, noun, preposition, or verb have been defined under semantic criteria. For example, nouns are defined as words that denote people, things, animals, and places. In many cases, the traditional definition works well as teachers, tables, cats, and schools are all categorized as nouns. However, there are many other cases in which the definition does not work. For instance, sincerity, love, and destruction are all nouns but they denote personality traits, an emotional state, and a process, respectively.

As an alternative, syntacticians categorize the parts of speech under distributional criteria. They group words that can fit in the syntactic context and then name the category. In the distributional context, for example, words such as dog, child, analysis, or love can fill in the blank, but other words like run, eliminate, or sadly cannot. In other words, no part of speech other than a noun can occur in the blank.

Bearing the description above in mind, consider the following examples that show the distributions of there and fast.

They repaired the car right there
They repaired the car right fast

They repaired the car very fast
They repaired the car very there

They repaired the car fast enough

2022_1.PNG,2022_1,"Head Movement, VP-ellipsis, affix lowering","The tense affix such as ed or s forms an independent head that is separated from a verb in the underlying structure. The tense affix needs to attach to a verb in the surface structure via so called head movement. To be specific, it lowers onto lexical verbs, and auxiliary verbs be and have raise to tense.

Joe finished the cake

Let us now observe the data that involve verb phrase ellipsis. Verb phrase ellipsis is assumed to be licensed when the verb phrase in the second conjunct is isomorphic to that of its corresponding antecedent. For example, the verb phrase of the second conjunct is identical to the one in the first conjunct, and deletion of the verb phrase is possible. The same holds of the following example. However, an interesting difference is observed. Namely, dummy do is required in the second conjunct in one case, but prohibited in the other.

To derive the grammatical sentences and prevent the ungrammatical ones, a certain order of syntactic operations must take place. For the first case, one operation must take place prior to the other, but for the second case, the order of the two operations must be reversed."
2022_2.PNG,2022_2,"Subjacency, binding node, wh-phrase","Subjacency is a syntactic constraint that restricts movement to be local. Namely, movement should cross over only one bounding node. Crossing over more than one bounding node in one cycle of movement would result in ungrammaticality.

What did Sue hear the rumor that Bill broke
What did Sue hear the rumor that Bill broke

The wh phrase involves two cycles of wh movement. In the first cycle, the wh phrase raises from the complement of broke to the specifier of the complementizer phrase in the embedded clause, from which it raises to the matrix specifier position of the complementizer phrase in the second cycle. It is crucial to note that the second cycle crosses over three bounding nodes. This is a violation of Subjacency and results in ungrammaticality.

Now consider a grammatical sentence which involves one cycle of wh movement crossing over two tense phrases, hence apparently violating Subjacency.

Which book does John seem to like

To explain the grammaticality of the sentence above, an additional condition should be imposed for one of the tense phrases not to be counted as a bounding node.

Complements of a verb are not bounding nodes.

Bearing the above description in mind, reconsider the sentence with what undergoing the second cycle of wh movement. When this happens, it crosses over two bounding nodes. This is because the complementizer phrase is no longer a bounding node.

2022_3.PNG,2022_3,"Coordination, complement, adjunct, pre-nominal position","Coordination is possible when two constituents share the same type of syntactic function. As shown in one example, a complement can be conjoined by another complement. If it is combined with an adjunct, however, ungrammaticality results.

We will not reveal the nature of the threat or where it came from
I went to the park and for health reason

The syntactic function of dependents, that is, complements or adjuncts, influences one replacement of nouns too. Note, for example, that a noun prince can be replaced by one in one sentence, but not in another. The difference lies in what syntactic function the prepositional phrase serves in each example. The noun is modified by an adjunct in the first case, but by a complement in the second.

The prince from Denmark and the one from Japan met each other yesterday
The prince of Denmark and the one of Japan met each other yesterday

It is possible for dependents of nouns to appear in a pre nominal position, which triggers structural ambiguity. For instance, Korean in the Korean professor can be interpreted as either complement or adjunct. The complement reading corresponds to the professor teaching the Korean language, and the adjunct reading corresponds to the professor from Korea.

The man who entered the room was the linguistics and Korean professor
Mina is not the Japanese professor but the Korean one"
2021_1.PNG,2021_1,"specifier, preposition, postposition","In the languages of the world, we have two different types of adposition: a preposition type, for example English, and a postposition type, for example Korean. With the preposition type, we find that a preposition head precedes its complement. As for the postposition type, a postposition follows its complement.

However, some linguists argue that all languages uniformly have the preposition system and the seemingly postposition system is derived from the preposition type by movement.

We can apply the analysis to the so called particle structure.

They left this part out

In this sentence, the noun phrase this part moves from the complement position of the head out to the specifier position."
2021_2.PNG,2021_2,"locative inversion, preposing, postposing","Locative inversion involves the preposing of a locative phrase before the verb and the postposing of the subject after the verb.

John ran into the house
Into the house ran John

A woman stood on the corner
On the corner stood a woman

Note that the second sentence can be derived from the first by moving the locative phrase into the house to the front of the sentence and by inverting the verb ran and the subject John. Likewise, we can derive the corresponding sentence with a woman. Meanwhile, there is some restriction with locative inversion. Consider the following examples.

My friend Mary seated my mother among the guests of honor
Among the guests of honor seated my mother my friend Mary
Among the guests of honor seated my friend Mary my mother

The women danced beautiful dances around the fire
Around the fire danced beautiful dances the women

All the examples above clearly show that the basic verb types affect the grammaticality of locative inversion.

2021_3.PNG,2021_3,"VP, TP, CP, coordination, wh-cleft sentence, promise, intend, believe","To account for some syntactic phenomena in English, we can resort to phrasal categories such as verb phrase, tense phrase, complementizer phrase, and so on. First, let us assume that only constituents which belong to the same phrasal category can be coordinated. For example, a noun phrase can conjoin with another noun phrase, but not with an adjective phrase.

The student or the teacher
The student or very pretty

The same restriction also holds true with clausal structures. The following structures are clearly different, since they cannot be coordinated by the conjunction or.

We did not intend you to hurt him
We did not intend for him to hurt you
We did not intend you to hurt him or for him to hurt you

So, based on the phrasal category and the assumption about coordination, we can explain the ungrammaticality of such sentences.

Second, the restriction on wh cleft sentences can also be attributed to phrasal categories.

What I will do is postpone the meeting

A verb phrase can be in the focus position after the verb of wh cleft sentences like the example above. Consider further the following examples.

Bill promised to behave himself
What Bill promised is to behave himself

They believe him to be innocent
What they believe is him to be innocent

The verb promise is known to take a complementizer phrase complement which is headed by a null complementizer, and we find that complementizer phrase can be in the focus position. Meanwhile, the verb believe requires a tense phrase complement, and from the ungrammaticality of the example above, it is clear that a tense phrase cannot be in the focus position of a wh cleft sentence. Thus, based on the types of phrasal categories, we can explain the restriction on wh cleft sentences.

2020_1.PNG,2020_1,"negative polarity item, c-command, temporal adverbials, locative adverbials, embedded reading, matrix reading","There is a class of words such as yet and any called negative polarity items. They are allowed in sentences containing a negative word such as not.

The defense strategy had not been determined yet

However, there is an additional structural condition for a negative polarity item to be licensed by negation. The negation has to c command the negative polarity item.

Any defense strategy had not been determined

A node c commands its sister nodes and all the daughter nodes of its sister nodes.

Given the definition of c command, not does not c command any. Hence, the sentence is ungrammatical.

Temporal and locational adverbials can be structurally ambiguous in that they can modify either a matrix element or an embedded element. In the following example, yesterday can modify the embedded predicate knew the answer. This reading is called an embedded reading. In the embedded reading, it is asked whether Mark knew the answer yesterday. By contrast, yesterday can also modify the matrix predicate wondered. This reading is called a matrix reading. In the matrix reading, yesterday is when Celin wondered about Mark.

In both sentences, the quantifier all modifies the subject the students. What is interesting is that in the second sentence, the quantifier positioned after the subject forms a discontinuous constituent with no major change in meaning.

This fact can be straightforwardly accounted for if it is assumed that the entire constituent all the students is base generated in the position of the verb phrase. As illustrated, all the students undergoes movement to the surface subject position. By contrast, just part of the constituent, the students, moves to the subject position, leaving all behind in its base position.

This account is based upon the verb phrase internal subject hypothesis, which states that a subject is base generated in the position of the verb phrase and in turn moves to the position of the tense phrase."
2019_1.PNG,2019_1,"extraposition, clausal modifiers of NPs, VP preposing, adjoin","Clausal modifiers of noun phrases which function as the subject or the object can move to the end of the sentence.

A man just came in who has red hair

John will not turn a friend who needs help away
John will not turn a friend away who needs help

Let us take a closer examination of the extraposition of the complementizer phrase from the object position. As confirmed in the following example, verb phrase preposing can be further applied and the resulting sentence is grammatical. This suggests that the extraposed complementizer phrase from the object position is adjoined to the verb phrase, since only phrasal constituents can move.

John said that he would not turn a friend away who needs help, and turn a friend away who needs help he would not

The whole process can be represented as follows. From the initial structure, the clausal modifier complementizer phrase is adjoined to the verb phrase, and the resulting verb phrase constituent moves to the front of the sentence.

From the brief observation, it can be proposed that an extraposed complementizer phrase is adjoined to the first phrasal constituent containing the noun phrase out of which it is extraposed.

In fact, there are two kinds of PRO. One is called arbitrary PRO, whose meaning is basically someone. Arbitrary PRO is like a referring expression or a pronoun in that it can get its meaning from outside the sentence. The other is non arbitrary PRO, which can be further distinguished into two varieties, obligatory control and optional control. The optional control is exemplified in the following example. PRO here can either refer back to John or it can have an arbitrary PRO reading. The obligatory control is exemplified in the next examples. PRO in one example obligatorily refers back to the main clause subject, hence called subject control, while PRO in the other obligatorily refers back to the main clause object, hence called object control.

Although both of the above sentences are intransitive, they are not of the same kind. They have different syntactic and semantic properties. In the first sentence, the subject originates in the specifier position external to the verb bar constituent, receiving an agent role. Verbs like jump are known as unergative verbs. However, in the second sentence, the superficial subject originates in the complement position within the immediate verb bar projection of the verb, receiving a theme role. Then it moves to subject position. Verbs like appear are known as unaccusative verbs.

The two types of intransitive verbs can be distinguished by means of tests such as the following. Unaccusative verbs like appear allow a word order called there inversion, where the underlying complement remains in its original position after the verb. On the other hand, since the subject of unergative verbs like jump does not originate in the complement position of the verbs, it is not allowed to appear in that position after the verbs with there inversion.

The meaning of the first sentence is equivalent to that of the second sentence.
